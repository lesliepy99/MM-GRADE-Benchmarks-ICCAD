Currently the `global_net_threshold` is set to a small number, and nets with larger degree will be ignored. You should set a larger value of global_net_threshold, for example, 2000.\\n The tcl example is as follows:\\n```\\n triton_part_design -global_net_threshold 2000\\n```.", "model_answer": "The presence of unconstrained hyperedges in your circuit partitioning could be due to several factors. The screenshot shows that the timing graph has 2101 unconstrained hyperedges, which might be influenced by the partitioning parameters used, such as the global net threshold and timing-aware settings. \n\nDocument \"partition_manager_1\" is highly relevant as it discusses the partition manager's capabilities, including handling constraints and timing-driven partitioning, which could help address the issue. Additionally, \"partition_manager_5\" provides insights into the partitioning process and parameters that might affect hyperedge constraints.

If both methods are used simultaneously, unexpected behavior might occur. To do floorplan with target aspect ratio, you should set the specific values of `utilization` and `aspect_ratio`, for example, you can run:\\n```\\ninitialize_floorplan -utilization 70 -aspect_ratio 0.3 -site site_Dummy\\n```", "model_answer": "The issue with the die area remaining square despite specifying an aspect ratio of 0.3 likely arises from setting both the die/core area and the aspect ratio simultaneously. According to the document \"floorplan_initialization_1,\" this can lead to unexpected behavior. To resolve this, you should choose either to specify the die/core area or the aspect ratio, but not both. Adjust your command to use only one method to achieve the desired aspect ratio."}
{"id": 3, "question": " The space between the core and the die is too small in the screenshot. How to enlarge the space between the core and die.", "gt_answer": " You can use the command `initialize_floorplan` with the option `core_space` to add space between core and die. The default value of `core_space` is 0, means no space in between. You can set `core_space` to be a reasonable value. You can set a single value for uniform spacing or provide four values for different spacing on each side. For example, to set a uniform space of 50 around the core, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space 50\n```\n\nOr, to set different spaces for each side, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space {15 20 25 30}\n```\n", "model_answer": "To enlarge the space between the core and the die, you should adjust the floorplan settings. Specifically, you can use the `initialize_floorplan` command with the `-core_space` option to specify the desired space around the core. This can be done by setting a single value for uniform spacing or four values for individual margins (bottom, top, left, right).

For example, you can use `place_pins -hor_layers metal3 -ver_layers metal2 -exclude bottom:*`", "model_answer": "To prevent pins from being placed in the region of the green rectangle, you can use the `place_pins` command with the `-exclude` option. This option allows you to specify regions where pins should not be placed. You can define the exclusion region using the syntax `-exclude edge:interval`, where you specify the edge and interval to exclude. For example, you might use `-exclude bottom:*` to exclude the entire bottom edge, which seems relevant to your screenshot."}
