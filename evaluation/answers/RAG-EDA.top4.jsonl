{"id": 1, "question": " After running partition on my circuit, why there are so many unconstrained hyperedges?", "gt_answer": " `global_net_threshold` specifies the maximal number of net that will be considered, and if the number of nets is larger than this threshold, the extra nets will be ignored. Currently the `global_net_threshold` is set to a small number, and nets with larger degree will be ignored. You should set a larger value of global_net_threshold, for example, 2000.\\n The tcl example is as follows:\\n```\\n triton_part_design -global_net_threshold 2000\\n```.", "model_answer": "After running the partition command, the number of unconstrained hyperedges might be due to several reasons. \n\nFirstly, the `-balance_constraint` option can be adjusted to allow for more imbalance between blocks. If you want to allow for more imbalance, increase the value of `-balance_constraint`.\n\nSecondly, the `-scale_factor` option can be adjusted to change the relative importance of different factors in the partitioning process. If you want to give more importance to other factors, adjust the `-scale_factor` accordingly.\n\nThirdly, the `-max_coarsen_iters` option can be adjusted to increase the number of iterations for coarsening. This can help in refining the partitioning process.\n\nLastly, the `-min_num_vertices_each_part` option can be adjusted to increase the minimum number of vertices in each partition.

This method overrides the automatic die size calculation based on the design size and utilization as shown in the `initialize_floorplan` command. Therefore, it's expected that the die is still a square regardless of the aspect ratio specified.\n\nIf you want to maintain the aspect ratio, you need to consider the utilization and aspect ratio when calculating the die area and core area. You can utilize the formula provided in the documentation:\n\n```tcl\ncore_area = design_area / (utilization / 100)\ncore_width = sqrt(core_area / aspect_ratio)\ncore_height = core_width * aspect_ratio\ncore = ( core_space_left, core_space_bottom )\n      ( core_space_left + core_width, core_space_bottom + core_height )\ndie =  ( 0, 0 )\n      ( core_width + core_space_left + core_space_right,\n        core_height + core_space_bottom + core_space_top )\n```\n\nYou can then use these calculations to set the die and core area using the `-die_area` and `-core_area` arguments in the `initialize_floorplan` command.\nenter\nhi"}

{"id": 30, "question": " In my PDN design, as is shown in the screenshot, the distances between the stripe pairs is too small and the stripes are very close to each other. How should I increase the distance between the stripe pairs?", "gt_answer": " In OpenROAD, the command `add_pdn_stripe` defines the patterns of power and ground stripes, and its argument `-pitch` controls the distance between each power/ground pair. To increase the distance between the stripe pairs, you can first set a larger value of `-pitch` for `add_pdn_stripe`, and then run `pdngen`. The script sample is as follows:\\n```\\n add_pdn_stripe -layer layer_name -pitch pitch_value\\n pdngen\\n```\\n.", "model_answer": "To adjust the distance between the stripes, you can use the `add_pdn_stripe` command again and set the `pitch` parameter to your desired value. Here is an example:\n\n```tcl\nadd_pdn_stripe -layer metal1 -width 0.17 -followpins -pitch 100.0\n```\nIn this example, the `add_pdn_stripe` command is used to define a new set of stripes on the `metal1` layer with a width of `0.17`.

To adjust this behavior, you can modify the site parameters or ensure that the core area coordinates are multiples of the site dimensions to prevent snapping.", "model_answer": "The snapping behavior of the core area could be caused by the floorplan initialization parameters. The `initialize_floorplan` command is responsible for setting up the floorplan, including the die area and core area. If the parameters used for initializing the floorplan are not set correctly, it could cause the core area to snap to a different position.\n\nTo adjust this, you need to re-run the `initialize_floorplan` command with updated parameters.

Consider adjusting parameters such as `-timing_driven_net_reweight_overflow`, `-timing_driven_net_weight_max`, and `-timing_driven_nets_percentage` to fine-tune the timing-driven placement. These parameters help manage the reweighting of nets based on their timing criticality and can influence the placement to optimize for timing performance.", "model_answer": "The first step is to read the LEF and DEF files for the standard cells, which you can do by using the `read_lef` and `read_def` commands. After that, you can enable the timing-driven placement with the `global_placement` command, and specify the desired density for the placement. For instance, if you want to set the density to 0.6, you would use the command `global_placement -density 0.6`. You can then write the new DEF file and compare it with the original one to see the differences.\n\nAfter that, you can further adjust the parameters related to the placement.

Ensuring that the timing paths and slack information are correctly extracted and utilized can help address this issue.", "model_answer": "According to the provided documents, the timing-aware partitioning process in OpenROAD is based on the slack propagation methodology. The timing cost of each path is calculated using the formula:\n$$t_p = (1- \\frac{slack_p - \\Delta}{clock\\_period})^\\mu$$\nwhere a fixed extra delay $\\Delta$ is introduced for timing guardband, and $\\mu$ (default 2) is the exponent.\n\nThe timing cost of a hyperedge is computed using the timing weight corresponding to hyperedge slack $slack_e$ and the accumulated timing cost of all paths traversing the hyperedge:\n$$t_e = (1- \\frac{slack_e -\\Delta}{clock\\_period})^\\mu + \\sum_{\\{p|e\\in p\\}}t_p$$\n\nThis timing cost of a hyperedge is then added to the connectivity score during the partitioning process, which is the basis for the timing-aware coarsening and refinement steps.\n\nHowever, the documents do not specify the exact reasons why this process might lead to 451 unconstrained hyperedges. It could be due to various factors such as the specific design characteristics, the settings of the timing guardband $\\Delta$ and the exponent $\\mu$, or the way the slack propagation is carried out.
