{"id": 1, "question": " After running partition on my circuit, why there are so many unconstrained hyperedges?", "gt_answer": " `global_net_threshold` specifies the maximal number of net that will be considered, and if the number of nets is larger than this threshold, the extra nets will be ignored. Currently the `global_net_threshold` is set to a small number, and nets with larger degree will be ignored. You should set a larger value of global_net_threshold, for example, 2000.\\n The tcl example is as follows:\\n```\\n triton_part_design -global_net_threshold 2000\\n```.", "model_answer": "The presence of 2101 unconstrained hyperedges in your circuit partitioning could be due to several factors. The partitioning parameters, such as the number of partitions, vertex and hyperedge dimensions, and the global net threshold, play a crucial role. Document `partition_manager_5` provides relevant information on these parameters, suggesting that adjusting the hyperedge dimension or global net threshold might help reduce unconstrained hyperedges. Additionally, ensuring that constraints are properly defined and applied during the partitioning process, as discussed in `partition_manager_3` and `partition_manager_1`, could also address this issue. Consider reviewing and adjusting these parameters and constraints to achieve a more constrained partitioning result."}
{"id": 2, "question": " For floorplan, I use the command `initialize_floorplan -die_area \"0 0 100 100\" -core_area \"10 10 90 90\" -aspect_ratio 0.3 -site site_Dummy`, why the resulted die is still a sqaure instead of a rectangle with aspect ratio 0.3?", "gt_answer": "There are two ways to set the floorplan dimensions: manually specifying the die/core area or specifying the utilization/aspect ratio. If both methods are used simultaneously, unexpected behavior might occur. To do floorplan with target aspect ratio, you should set the specific values of `utilization` and `aspect_ratio`, for example, you can run:\\n```\\ninitialize_floorplan -utilization 70 -aspect_ratio 0.3 -site site_Dummy\\n```", "model_answer": "The issue you're experiencing with the aspect ratio not being applied correctly is likely due to specifying both the die/core area and the aspect ratio simultaneously. According to the document \"floorplan_initialization_1,\" unexpected behavior can occur when both parameters are set. To resolve this, you should choose one method: either specify the die/core area or use the aspect ratio with utilization. Adjust your command to avoid setting both parameters at the same time."}
{"id": 3, "question": " The space between the core and the die is too small in the screenshot. How to enlarge the space between the core and die.", "gt_answer": " You can use the command `initialize_floorplan` with the option `core_space` to add space between core and die. The default value of `core_space` is 0, means no space in between. You can set `core_space` to be a reasonable value. You can set a single value for uniform spacing or provide four values for different spacing on each side. For example, to set a uniform space of 50 around the core, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space 50\n```\n\nOr, to set different spaces for each side, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space {15 20 25 30}\n```\n", "model_answer": "To enlarge the space between the core and die, you can adjust the floorplan settings in OpenROAD. Use the `initialize_floorplan` command with the `-core_space` option to specify the desired space around the core. Refer to the document \"floorplan_initialization_1\" for detailed instructions on setting the core and die areas. You can also look at \"flow-scripts-tutorial_26\" for examples of floorplan initialization."}

To solve the warning, you need to ensure that the x_offset value is less than the width of the die, for example, you can set `x_offset` to be a value less than 200.", "model_answer": "The warning indicates that the x offset for metal2 is greater than the die width, causing the track pattern to be skipped. To fix this, you should adjust the `-x_offset` parameter in the `make_tracks` command to ensure it is within the die width. Refer to the `floorplan_initialization_2` document for guidance on using the `make_tracks` command and its parameters."}
{"id": 5, "question": " When setting the mirror constraints of io pins, I get the following error, how can I resolve it?", "gt_answer": "The error message indicates that the list of pins must have an even number of pins. When you use the `-mirrored_pins` option of the `set_io_pin_constraint` command, the number of pins in the `mirrored_pins` list must be even. For example, you can use \n\n```tcl\nset_io_pin_constraint -mirrored_pins {pin1 pin2 pin3 pin4}\n```\n\n", "model_answer": "The error you are encountering is due to the requirement that the list of pins specified with the `-mirrored_pins` option in the `set_io_pin_constraint` command must have an even number of pins. This is because each pin needs a corresponding mirrored pair. To resolve this error, ensure that the list of pins you provide is even. For example, if you have six pins, they should be paired as `{pin1 pin2 pin3 pin4 pin5 pin6}`. Adjust your pin list accordingly to meet this requirement."}
{"id": 6, "question": " When setting the io pin constraints, I get the following error, how to solve?", "gt_answer": " As in the log, when `-group` flag is enabled, the `-pin_names` argument is required. Therefore, you should include both `-pin_names` and `-group` in your command to avoid the error.", "model_answer": "The error you are encountering is due to the simultaneous use of `-region` and `-mirrored_pins` constraints in the `set_io_pin_constraint` command. According to the relevant documentation (pin_placement_2), these two options cannot be used together. To resolve the error, you should separate the constraints into different commands, using `-mirrored_pins` alone in one command and `-region` in another if needed."}

This command allows you to set region constraints for pins based on their direction. You can specify the direction as \"input\" and the region as \"top\" to ensure that all input pins are placed at the top of the die. Here is an example command:\n\n```tcl\nset_io_pin_constraint -direction input -region top:*\n```\n\nThis command will restrict all input pins to the top edge of the die.

{"id": 106, "question": "The log  says the netlist has more than 50000 vertices and hyperedges, but why there are only 1000 timing paths?", "gt_answer": "For the command `triton_part_design`, the option `-top_n` controls the number of critical timing paths reported, and the default number is 1000. If you want to report more paths, set a lager num of `-top_n`. For example, to report 5000 paths, run the tcl script:\\\\n```\\\\n triton_part_design -top_n 5000\\\\n```.", "model_answer": "The discrepancy between the large number of vertices and hyperedges and the smaller number of timing paths is due to the extraction of only the top 1,000 critical timing paths, as indicated in the log. This is a common practice to focus on the most critical paths for optimization. The document \"partition_manager_7\" confirms this by explaining the use of the `-top_n` parameter to extract a specified number of critical timing paths. The timing-aware partitioning process, as described in \"partition_manager_4,\" further supports this approach by optimizing for critical paths."}
