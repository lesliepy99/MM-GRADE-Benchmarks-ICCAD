Currently the `global_net_threshold` is set to a small number, and nets with larger degree will be ignored. You should set a larger value of global_net_threshold, for example, 2000.\\n The tcl example is as follows:\\n```\\n triton_part_design -global_net_threshold 2000\\n```.", "model_answer": ": According to the document \"partition_manager_5,\" one possible reason for having many unconstrained hyperedges is the use of the `-thr_coarsen_hyperedge_size_skip` parameter. If this parameter is set too high, it can cause the tool to ignore large hyperedges, potentially leading to an increase in unconstrained hyperedges. The default value for this parameter is 200, but it can be adjusted to a lower value to see if it reduces the number of unconstrained hyperedges."}

In this case, an aspect ratio of 0.3 means that the height is 30% of the width. If the die area is set to \"0 0 100 100\", the width and height of the die will be 100 microns each.

{"id": 30, "question": " In my PDN design, as is shown in the screenshot, the distances between the stripe pairs is too small and the stripes are very close to each other. How should I increase the distance between the stripe pairs?", "gt_answer": " In OpenROAD, the command `add_pdn_stripe` defines the patterns of power and ground stripes, and its argument `-pitch` controls the distance between each power/ground pair. To increase the distance between the stripe pairs, you can first set a larger value of `-pitch` for `add_pdn_stripe`, and then run `pdngen`. The script sample is as follows:\\n```\\n add_pdn_stripe -layer layer_name -pitch pitch_value\\n pdngen\\n```\\n.", "model_answer": ": To increase the distance between the stripe pairs in your PDN design, you can adjust the `-pitch` parameter in the `add_pdn_stripe` command. The `-pitch` parameter specifies the distance between each power/ground pair. For example, if you want to set the pitch to 60.0, you can use the following command:\n\n```tcl\nadd_pdn_stripe -grid main_grid -layer metal1 -pitch 60.0\n```\n\nThis will increase the distance between the stripe pairs, making them less close to each other."}

This suggests a mismatch between the desired width and the available grid slots, which is likely causing the error. To resolve this, you should adjust the width to align with the manufacturing grid. For example, you can modify the `-widths` parameter to be a multiple of the grid size:\n\n```tcl\nadd_pdn_ring -grid \"Core\" -layers {metal5 metal6} -widths 2.0 -spacings 2.0 -core_offsets 2.0\n```\n\nEnsure that the width values are multiples of the grid size to avoid this error."}
