{"id": 1, "question": " After running partition on my circuit, why there are so many unconstrained hyperedges?", "gt_answer": " `global_net_threshold` specifies the maximal number of net that will be considered, and if the number of nets is larger than this threshold, the extra nets will be ignored. Currently the `global_net_threshold` is set to a small number, and nets with larger degree will be ignored. You should set a larger value of global_net_threshold, for example, 2000.\\n The tcl example is as follows:\\n```\\n triton_part_design -global_net_threshold 2000\\n```.", "model_answer": "The presence of many unconstrained hyperedges could be due to the partitioning parameters used, such as the global net threshold and timing-aware flag. The document \"partition_manager_7\" is highly relevant as it details the command options and parameters that influence partitioning, which could help in adjusting settings to reduce unconstrained hyperedges. Additionally, \"partition_manager_3\" provides insights into the algorithm's steps, which might help in understanding the underlying causes of unconstrained hyperedges. Adjusting parameters like the global net threshold or exploring constraints-driven coarsening might address the issue."}
{"id": 2, "question": " For floorplan, I use the command `initialize_floorplan -die_area \"0 0 100 100\" -core_area \"10 10 90 90\" -aspect_ratio 0.3 -site site_Dummy`, why the resulted die is still a sqaure instead of a rectangle with aspect ratio 0.3?", "gt_answer": "There are two ways to set the floorplan dimensions: manually specifying the die/core area or specifying the utilization/aspect ratio. If both methods are used simultaneously, unexpected behavior might occur. To do floorplan with target aspect ratio, you should set the specific values of `utilization` and `aspect_ratio`, for example, you can run:\\n```\\ninitialize_floorplan -utilization 70 -aspect_ratio 0.3 -site site_Dummy\\n```", "model_answer": "The issue with the die being square instead of having the specified aspect ratio of 0.3 likely arises from conflicting parameters in your command. According to the document \"floorplan_initialization_1,\" specifying both die/core area and aspect ratio can lead to unexpected behavior. To resolve this, ensure that you are not setting both parameters simultaneously. You might need to choose either to specify the die/core area or to use the aspect ratio with utilization to achieve the desired floorplan shape."}
{"id": 3, "question": " The space between the core and the die is too small in the screenshot. How to enlarge the space between the core and die.", "gt_answer": " You can use the command `initialize_floorplan` with the option `core_space` to add space between core and die. The default value of `core_space` is 0, means no space in between. You can set `core_space` to be a reasonable value. You can set a single value for uniform spacing or provide four values for different spacing on each side. For example, to set a uniform space of 50 around the core, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space 50\n```\n\nOr, to set different spaces for each side, you can use:\n```tcl\ninitialize_floorplan -die_area {die area} -core_area {core area} -core_space {15 20 25 30}\n```\n", "model_answer": "To enlarge the space between the core and the die, you might consider adjusting the pin placement strategy as discussed in the \"pin_placement_0\" document. This could involve repositioning pins to allow for more space. Additionally, reviewing the design area and utilization settings in the \"gate_resizing_0\" document might provide insights into managing the core area to achieve the desired spacing. However, neither document provides a direct solution, so further exploration of OpenROAD's layout configuration options may be necessary."}
{"id": 4, "question": "After make tracks, I get the warning in the screenshot, how should I fix?", "gt_answer": " From the screenshot, the width of the die is 200, and in your `make_tracks` command, the value of `-x_offset` is set to be 300. To solve the warning, you need to ensure that the x_offset value is less than the width of the die, for example, you can set `x_offset` to be a value less than 200.", "model_answer": "The warning indicates that the x offset for the metal2 track pattern is greater than the die width, causing the track pattern to be skipped. To fix this, you should adjust the x offset value in your track configuration to ensure it is within the die width. This can be done by modifying the `-x_offset` parameter in your `make_tracks` command to a value that is less than or equal to the die width."}

To resolve this error, ensure that the number of pins specified in the `-mirrored_pins` option is even. Adjust the list of pins accordingly to meet this requirement."}
{"id": 6, "question": " When setting the io pin constraints, I get the following error, how to solve?", "gt_answer": " As in the log, when `-group` flag is enabled, the `-pin_names` argument is required. Therefore, you should include both `-pin_names` and `-group` in your command to avoid the error.", "model_answer": "The error message indicates that you cannot use both `-region` and `-mirrored_pins` constraints at the same time when setting IO pin constraints. To resolve this issue, you should choose either the `-region` or `-mirrored_pins` constraint, but not both. Review your design requirements to determine which constraint is necessary for your specific use case and adjust the command accordingly. If further guidance is needed, consulting the OpenROAD documentation or community forums for specific command usage might be helpful."}

You want to exclude the pins from being placed on this region. To do this, you can use the `place_pins` command with the `-exclude` option. For example, you can use `place_pins -hor_layers metal3 -ver_layers metal2 -exclude bottom:*`", "model_answer": "To prevent pins from being placed in the region of the green rectangle, you should use the pin placement module in OpenROAD. This module allows you to place pins on the boundary of the die and can help you set constraints to avoid specific areas. You may need to define a region or constraint in your design to ensure pins are not placed within the green rectangle."}
{"id": 11, "question": " I place pins with some group constraints and get the following error, how should I resolve?", "gt_answer": " In the screenshot, pins resp_msg[13] and resp_msg[11] are assigned to more than one groups, which causes the error. Putting each pin to exactly one group will solve this error.", "model_answer": "To resolve the error regarding pins `resp_msg[13]` and `resp_msg[11]` being assigned to multiple groups, you should ensure that each pin is assigned to only one group. Review the `place_pins` command and adjust the `-group_pins` constraints to eliminate overlapping assignments.

To debug and solve this issue, you should:\n\n1. **Check Layer Specifications**: Verify the minimum width requirements for \"metal7\" in your design rules or technology file. Ensure that the pin size meets or exceeds these requirements.\n\n2. **Adjust Pin Size**: Modify the `-pin_size` parameter in your `place_pin` command to ensure the pin width is at least 0.40u, as required by the layer specifications.\n\n3. **Consult Documentation**: Although the provided documents are not directly relevant, you may want to refer to OpenROAD's official documentation or community forums for additional guidance on pin placement and design rule checks.\n\nBy ensuring the pin dimensions comply with the layer's minimum width requirements, you should be able to resolve the error."}
{"id": 18, "question": " When I generate the bump array, I found that some bumps are out of the die boundary. What is the reason and how should I solve?", "gt_answer": " The bumps are out of the die boundary because the origin, the number of rows and columns and the pitch of the bump array are not correctly set. To make the bump array within the die boundary, you can either decrease the number of `-rows` and `-columns`, adjust the value of `origin`, or set a smaller number for the `-pitch`.", "model_answer": "The issue of bumps being out of the die boundary is likely due to the origin and pitch settings used in the bump array generation command. The command `make io bump array -bump DUMMY BUMP -origin \"200 200\" -rows 16 -columns 16 -pitch \"200 200\"` suggests that the starting point and spacing might be causing the bumps to extend beyond the die limits. \n\nTo resolve this, you should adjust the origin and pitch values to ensure that all bumps fit within the die boundary. You can also check the design database settings in OpenDB to ensure that the die boundary is correctly defined and that the bump array generation respects these constraints."}

{"id": 24, "question": "In my layout, the macros are in the middle of the core. How should I push them to the boundary?", "gt_answer": " You can enable the `corner_max_wl` style of `macro_placement` command, which will maximise the wirelength of connections between the macros to force them to the corners.", "model_answer": "To push the macros to the boundary of the core, you might consider using partitioning techniques to redefine the layout regions. The \"Partition Manager\" document (partition_manager_3) discusses algorithms that could help in managing and refining the placement of components within a layout. You may need to adjust the constraints and parameters to ensure the macros are moved towards the boundary. Additionally, reviewing power distribution policies (power_distribution_network_generator_0) might provide insights into managing space around macros."}
{"id": 25, "question": " How to add some spaces between these two macros in the screenshot?", "gt_answer": " You can set the `-halo` argument of the `macro_placement` command, which add horizontal and vertical halos around macros.
