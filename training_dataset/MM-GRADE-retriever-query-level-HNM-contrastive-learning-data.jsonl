It takes as inputs \n- Hypergraph $H(V,E)$ in `.hgr` format.\n- Vertex weight $w_v \\in \\mathcal{R}_+^m$\n- Hyperedge weight $w_e \\in \\mathcal{R}_+^n$\n- Number of blocks $K$.\n- Imbalance factor $\\epsilon$.\n- User-specified cost function $\\phi$.\n\nThere are five main steps in the main algorithm,\nmainly 1) constraints-driven coarsening,\n2) initial partitioning, 3) refinement, 4) cut-overlay clustering and\npartitioning (COCP), and 5) V-cycle refinement. The steps for the \ntiming-aware algorithm may be found in the next [section](#timing-aware-algorithm). \n\n1. Constraints-Driven Coarsening\n\nThe first step involves multilevel coarsening. Specifically, at each level,\nclusters of vertices are identified, and the merged and represented\nas a single vertex in the resulting coarser hypergraph. In this algorithm,\nthe First-Choice scheme is used, which traverses the vertices in the \nhypergraph according to a given ordering and merges pairs of vertices with\nhigh connectivity. The connectivity between a pair of vertices $(u,v)$\nis measured as follows:\n\n$$r(u, v) = \\sum_{e\\in \\{I(v)\\cap I(u)\\}} \\frac{\\langle \\alpha, w_e\\rangle}{|e|-1}$$\n\nTo efficiently manage multiple constraints, the following enhancements are \nmade to the coarsening scheme above:\n\n- **Fixed Vertex Constraint**: Fixed vertices that belong to the same partitioning block are merged into a single vertex. \n- **Grouping Constraint**: Vertices that belong to the same group are merged into a single vertex.\n- **Embedding Constraint**: The embedding information is incorporated into the heavy-edge rating function. The new connectivity is updated as follows:\n\n$$\\hat{r}(u, v) = r(u, v) + \\rho\\frac{1}{||X_u - X_v||_2}$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is a normalization factor set to the average distance between two\nvertex embeddings. When vertices $v_1, ... , v_t$ are merged into a single\nvertex $v_{coarse}$, the corresponding vertex embedding $X_{v_{coarse}}$\nis defined as the *center of gravity* of $t$ vertices:\n\n$$X_{v_{coarse}} = \\sum_{j=1}^{t} \\frac{||w_{v_j}||}{M} X_{v_j},\\ where\\ M= \\sum_{j=1}^t ||w_{v_j}|| $$\n\n- **Community Guidance**: Only vertices within the same community are\n  considered for merging.\n- **Tie-breaking mechanism**: If multiple neighbor pairs have the same rating\n  score, combine the lexicographically first unmatched vertex to break ties.\n\n2. Initial Partitioning\n\nAfter completing the coarsening process, an initial partitioning solution for\nthe coarsest hypergraph $H_c$ is derived. Two sub-steps are involved in this:\nthe best partitioning solution from random and VILE partitioning is chosen\nfrom $\\eta = 50$ runs as a warm-start to the ILP-based partitioner. The\noptimization is based on only the cut size rather than the cost function\n$\\phi$ to keep the runtime reasonable.\n\n3. Refinement\n\nAfter a feasible solution $H_{c_\\xi}$ is obtained by initial partitioning,\nuncoarsening and move-based refinement is performed to improve the\npartitioning solution. Three refinement heuristics are applied in sequence:\n- **$K$-way pairwise FM (PM)**: This addresses multi-way partitioning\n  as concurrent bi-partitioning problems in a restricted version of K-way\n  Fiduccia–Mattheyses (FM) algorithm. First, $\\lfloor K/2\\rfloor $ pairs of\n  blocks are obtained, with refinement-specific vertex movements restricted\n  to associated paired blocks. Next, two-way FM is concurrently performed on\n  all the block pairs. finally, a new configuration of block pairs is computed\n  at the end of the PM.\n- **Direct $K$-way FM**: Using $K$ priority queues, for each block $V_i$,\n  establish a priority queue that stores the vertices that can be potentially\n  moved from the current block to block $V_i$. This queue is ordered according\n  to the gain of the vertices. Gain is defined as the reduction in cost\n  function from the movement of the vertex from the current block to $V_i$.\n  Next, after a vertex move, each priority queue is updated independently, thus\n  enabling parallel updates via multi-threading. Next, early-stop is implemented\n  by limiting the maximum number of vertices moved to 100 per pass. Finally,\n  the *corking effect* is mitigated by traversing the priority queue belonging\n  to the vertex with the highest gain and identifying a feasible vertex move.\n- **Greedy Hyperedge Refinement (HER)**: First, randomly visit all\n  hyperedges. For each hyperedge $e$ that crosses the partition boundary,\n  determine whether a subset of vertices in $e$ can be moved without violating\n  the multi-dimensional balance constraints. The objective is to make $e$\n  entirely constrained in a block.\n\n4. Cut-Overlay Clustering and Partitioning (COCP)\n\nCut-overlay Clustering and Partitioning (COCP) is a mechanism to\ncombine multiple good-quality partitioning solutions to generate an\nimproved solution. To begin, the sets of hyperedges cut in the $\\theta$\ncandidate solutions are denoted as $E_1,..., E_\\theta \\subset E$.  First,\n$\\cup_{i=1}^\\theta E_i$ is removed from the hypergraph $H(V, E)$, resulting in\na number of connected components. Next, all vertices within each connected\ncomponent are merged to form a coarser hypergraph $H_{overlay}$. If the\nnumber of vertices in $H_{overlay}$ is less than $thr_{ilp}$, ILP-based\npartitioning is performed. If not, a single round of constraints-driven\ncoarsening is conducted to further reduce the size of $H_{overlay}$\nand generate a coarser hypergraph $H_{overlay}^{'}$. Finally, multilevel\nrefinement is performed to further improve the partitioning solution at\neach level of the hierarchy and return the improved solution $S^{'}$.\n\n5. V-Cycle Refinement\n\nCut-overlay clustering and partitioning produces a high-quality partitioning\nsolution $S^{'}$. To improve it, there are three phases similar to *hMETIS*,\nnamely multilevel coarsening, ILP-based partitioning, and refinement.\nFirstly, in multilevel partitioning, $S^{'}$ is used as a community guidance\nfor the constraints-driven coarsening. Only vertices within the same block\nare permitted to be merged to ensure that the current solution $S^{'}$\nis preserved in the coarsest hypergraph $H_{c_\\xi}$. In the ILP-based\npartitioning phase, if the number of vertices in $H_{c_\\xi}$ does not exceed\n$thr_{ilp}$, run ILP-based partitioning to improve $S^{'}$. Otherwise,\ncontinue with $S^{'}$ in successive iterations of these two steps (default\nset to 2). The refinement phase is conducted as per step 3.\n\n![](./doc/algo.webp)<center>TritonPart algorithm at a glance</center>\n\n", "neg_img": ["source_images/partition_manager/partition_manager_1.png", "source_images/partition_manager/partition_manager_1.png"], "neg_text": ["What could be the reason for the error message \"invalid command name '-hypergraph_file'\" when running the `triton_part_hypergraph` command with the parameters shown in the screenshot?", "Why am I getting the error \"invalid command name '-hypergraph_file'\" when trying to partition my netlist using the `triton_part_hypergraph` command?"], "q_type": "it", "c_type": "mix", "reference": ["partition_manager_3"]}

A slack\npropagation methodology is used that optimizes cuts for both timing-critical\nand timing-noncritical paths.\n\n1. Extraction of Timing Paths and Slack Information\n\nFirst, the top $P$ timing-critical paths and the slack information of each\nhyperedge using the wireload model (WLM) is obtained from *OpenSTA*. The\ntiming cost of each path is then calculated:\n\n$$t_p = (1- \\frac{slack_p - \\Delta}{clock\\_period})^\\mu$$\n\nwhere a fixed extra delay $\\Delta$ is introduced for timing guardband,\nand $\\mu$ (default 2) is the exponent.\n\nThe snaking factor of a path $SF(p)$ is defined as the maximum number\nof block reentries along the path $p$. The timing cost of a hyperedge is\ncomputed using the timing weight corresponding to hyperedge slack $slack_e$\nand the accumulated timing cost of all paths traversing the hyperedge.\n\n$$t_e = (1- \\frac{slack_e -\\Delta}{clock\\_period})^\\mu + \\sum_{\\{p|e\\in p\\}}t_p$$\n\n2. Timing-aware Coarsening\n\nThe timing-aware feature is achieved by adding a timing cost of hyperedge\n$t_e$ to the connectivity score earlier mentioned. If vertices $(u,v)$\nare associated with multiple critical paths, then they are more likely to\nbe merged. This is reflected in the update score function:\n\n$$r_t(u,v) = \\hat{r}(u,v) + \\sum_{e\\in\\{I(v) \\cap I(u)\\}} \\frac{\\beta t_e}{|e| - 1}$$\n\n3. Timing-aware Refinement\n\nTiming-aware refinement is based on a similar cost function as the main\nalgorithm. Instead, an additional slack propagation step is performed at\nthe end of each PM/FM/HER pass.\n\n", "neg_img": ["source_images/partition_manager/partition_manager_3.png"], "neg_text": ["Why is the timing-driven mode not supported in the partitioning process for the hypergraph file `sparcT1_core.hgr`?"], "q_type": "it", "c_type": "mix", "reference": ["partition_manager_4"]}

The multiplier\nis scaled from the full value for the worst slack, to 1.0 at the\n`timing_driven_nets_percentage` point. Use the `set_wire_rc` command to set\nresistance and capacitance of estimated wires used for timing. \n\nTiming-driven iterations are triggered based on a list of overflow threshold \nvalues. Each time the placer execution reaches these overflow values, the \nresizer is executed. This process can be costly in terms of runtime. The \noverflow values for recalculating weights can be modified with \n`-timing_driven_net_reweight_overflow`, you may use less overflow threshold \nvalues to decrease runtime, for example.\n\nWhen the routability-driven option is enabled, each of its iterations will \nexecute RUDY to provide an estimation of routing congestion.
